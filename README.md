## Story
Everybody said that going anywhere so close to dusk with a blizzard on the way was a ***bad*** idea. But of course, you knew better.

Well, not you're lost in the woods, with no idea which way to go to reach civilization again. 
Because of the blizzard you can barely see five feet in front of you, and you're sure that if you try to press on or turn back, you will not make it. 
Your only chance is to wait until the sun comes up and the wind dies down a bit, so you could figure out which way to go.

Save your matches. Save your warmth. This will be a long night.

## Gameplay
The goal of the game is to survive for a set period of time. In order to do that you will need to maintain a fire to keep yourself warm.

Your warmth meter will gradually decrease, unless you're close to a burning fire, which will raise the meter (but only up to 100). If the meter reaches 0, you die.


A fire needs to be refueled by wood you can find lying around (you don't have an axe, so chopping down any of those trees around is not an option).

You start the game next to a fire. It's a good idea to keep it going for as long as possible, but eventually you will use up all of the wood in the area. 
Or maybe you won't be able to find your way back in the dark. In that case you can use one of your three matches to start a new fire. 
Starting a fire using a match still requires wood, so you won't be able to do so unless you have any on you.

Be careful: once you're out of matches, you can't get more!
